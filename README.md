# Non-AI detection algorithms perform as well as AI models in extracting chief complaints
This repository shares the code used by Kanpa et al. for predicting chief complaints using a symbolic reasoning model and large language models (LLMs).

There are two scripts. Script 1 generates the predictions and tests accuracy of the models, as per the ratings of our clinicians. Script 2 generates the usage information of all models tested.
